### What it does
This is repository of demo node app for to deploy on ecs fargate cluster using CICD Pipeline and load balancer.

### Things i learned
- AWS CodeBuild
- AWS CodePipeline
- ECS Fargate
- ECS Cluster and Task Definition
- ALB and Target Groups
- Docker Image Building

### How to run?

CICD Pipeline using AWS CodePipeline from Github to ECS Tasks with load balancing across containers.
- Create a cluster a task definition
- To add container (port 8080) you should give image path of ECR that push and pull and to deploy to ecs cluster. Add memory and cpu limits.
- Make a repository and use uri in adding container while creating task definition
- To balance between task: Create ALB and load balancer will listen to port 80 . Use port 8080 and IPâ€™s in Target Group because docker container will expose that.
- Create a service in cluster, and select your load balancer and the vpc to operate. Use all the subnets for high availability. Listen to 8080 via custom tcp http in sg(this sg is firewall for task).
- CICD Pipeline : Now setup cicd, create codebuild project, which will pull from github and build using buildspec.yml a docker image and push to ecr.
- Give permission to service role for Amazonec2ContainerRegistryFullAccess.
- Create a codepipeline, enable github webhooks.
